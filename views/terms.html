        <p>Welcome to the Mentorbox website (the “Mentorbox Site”), 
            owned and operated by Mentorbox, LLC (“Mentorbox,” “we,” 
            or “us”). This page explains the terms by which you may 
            use the Mentorbox Site, including purchase of Mentorbox 
            products (“Products”) thereon, and our online and/or mobile 
            services, and software provided on or in connection with the 
            service (collectively, the “Service”). By accessing or using 
            the Service, or clicking a button or checking a box marked “I 
            Agree” or something similar, you signify that you have read, 
            understood, and agree to be bound by these Terms of Use (these “Terms”), 
            to the collection and use of your information as set forth in the 
            Mentorbox Privacy Policy and to our Refund Policy, each of which 
            are hereby incorporated by reference. These Terms apply to all 
            visitors, users, and others who register for or otherwise access 
            the Service (“Users”).
        </p>

            Certain services may be subject to additional terms and conditions 
            specified by us from time to time, and your use of such services is 
            subject to those additional terms and conditions, which are hereby 
            incorporated into these Terms by reference.
        </p>

        <p>
            Please read this agreement carefully to ensure that you understand each provision. 
            These Terms contain a mandatory individual arbitration and class action/jury trial 
            waiver provision that requires the use of arbitration on an individual basis to 
            resolve disputes, rather than jury trials or class actions.

            international laws, rules and regulations. Any use or access to the Service by anyone 
            under 13 is strictly prohibited and in violation of these Terms. The Service is not

        <p>

            limited, non-transferable, freely revocable license to use the Service for your personal, 
            noncommercial use only and as permitted by the features of the Service. Mentorbox reserves 
            all rights not expressly granted herein in the Service and the Mentorbox Content (as defined below).

        </p>


        <!--C.  Mentorbox Accounts  -->


        <p>
            Your Mentorbox account gives you access to the services and functionality that we may establish and 
            maintain from time to time and in our sole discretion. We may maintain different types of accounts 
            for different types of Users. If you open a Mentorbox account on behalf of a company, organization, 
            or other entity, then (a) “you” includes you and that entity, and (b) you represent and warrant that 
            you are an authorized representative of the entity with the authority to bind the entity to these Terms, 
            and that you agree to these Terms on the entity’s behalf.
        </p>

        <p>
            You may never use another User’s account without permission. When creating your account, you must provide 
            accurate and complete information, and you must keep this information up to date. You are solely responsible 
            for the activity that occurs on your account, and you must keep your account password secure. We encourage 
            you to use “strong” passwords (passwords that use a combination of upper and lower case letters, numbers and symbols) 
            with your account. You must notify Mentorbox immediately of any breach of security or unauthorized use of your account. 
            Mentorbox will not be liable for any losses caused by any unauthorized use of your account.

            By providing Mentorbox your email address you consent to our using the email address to send you Service-related notices, 
            including any notices required by law, in lieu of communication by postal mail. We may also use your email address to send 
            you other messages, such as changes to features of the Service, information about Mentorbox products and special offers. 
            We may also share your email address with third parties to provide you with additional information, such as about order 
            fulfillment or third-party products. If you do not want to receive such email messages, you may opt out by contacting us 
            here: support@mentorbox.com. Opting out may prevent you from receiving email messages regarding updates, improvements, or offers.
