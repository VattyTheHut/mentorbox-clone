            <div class="about-text">
                <p>Jennifer Ackerman has been writing about science and nature for 30 years.  
                    Her most recent book, The Genius of Birds (Penguin Press, April 2016), explores 
                    the intelligence of birds.  Her previous books include Ah-Choo! The Uncommon 
                    Life of Your Common Cold (Twelve Press, 2010), Sex Sleep Eat Drink Dream:  
                    A Day in the Life of Your Body (Houghton Mifflin, 2007), Chance in the House of Fate:  
                    A Natural History of Heredity (Houghton Mifflin 2001), and Notes from the Shore 
                    (Viking Penguin, 1995).  A contributor to Scientific American, National Geographic 
                    Magazine, The New York Times, and many other publications, Jennifer is the recipient 
                    of numerous awards and fellowships, including an NEA Literature Fellowship in Nonfiction, 
                    a Bunting Institute Fellowship, and a grant from the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation.  
                    Her articles and essays have been included in several anthologies, among them, Best American 
                    Science Writing, The Nature Reader, Best Nature Writing, Flights of Imagination: Extraordinary 
                    Writings About Birds, and The Penguin Book of the Ocean.  Jennifer’s work aims to explain and 
                    interpret science for a lay audience and to explore the riddle of humanity’s place in the natural 
                    world, blending scientific knowledge with imaginative vision.
