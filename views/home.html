            Jennifer Ackerman has been writing about science, nature, 
            and human biology for almost three decades.  Her most recent 
            book is the New York TImes bestseller, The Genius of Birds 
            (Penguin Press, 2016; paperback, 2017).  Scientific American calls 
            the book â€œa lyrical testimony to the wonders of avian intelligence," 
            and the Wall Street Journal, "a gloriously provocative and highly entertaining book."  
            The book was a finalist for the National Academies Communication Book Award.  
            It was named as a "Best Science Book of 2016" by National Public Radio's Science Friday, 
            a "best book of the year" by The Spectator and the National Post, and a "nature book of 
            the year" by the London Sunday Times.   It was a finalist for the 2017 National Academies 
            Communication Book Award and was long-listed for the PEN/E.O. Wilson Literary Science Writing Award.  
            The Genius of Birds is published in fifteen languages.
